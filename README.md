# NLU-Monitoring-App
First iteration of public monitoring apps for NLU

# What is this for?
Application owners may be curious as to how users are interacting with Insight Advisor in their respectively owned applications. Qlik has built support for the public endpoint that will provide this level of visibility to owners but also foster a comprehensive user feedback loop between users and owners. This feature is meant to drive action, specifically around using these events to make marked improvements to the application, as well as drive usage and adoption.

This is a personal project to streamline the use of this API, simply replace your API Key and point to relevant applications in the tenant.

# What type of connection(s) are used?
The connection can be made through a variety of API tools, an example has been provided where a rest connection exists within a QlikSense Application and corresponding sheets have been generated to shine a light on items of interest to the Application Owner. The Owner can point to concrete metrics and build a roadmap on how to improve the application. This can also be done in Postman with the same steps.
